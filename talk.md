###Data!
Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source. Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for three months â€“ from July to September. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).  
Each team is comprised of two students and has the support of local coaches and a supervisor. Some teams even have a coaching company (that hosts them and offers their coaches)
As of 2015, Rails Girls Summer of Code is in its third year!  

#### This year's stats:
#####20 teams
