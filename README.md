Rails Girls Summer of Code slides
============
Are you a Rails Girls Summer of Code student and up for a (lightning) talk at a Ruby conference? You're in luck. We've created this little repo for you, with images you can use, a basic slides layout and some default slides mentioning stats and our awesome sponsors!

How to go about this? Well... ```git clone``` this repo and use it for your own purposes. 
Or just download the files: `2015_example_slides.ppt` (Powerpoint), `2015_example_slides.key` (Keynote) or `2015_example_slides.pdf`.  
If you want to make your own slides, you can find some of our images (including the sponsor logos and our pixel heart) in the `img` folder.

Good luck! (or: break a leg!)
