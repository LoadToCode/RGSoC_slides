Rails Girls Summer of Code slides
============
Are you a Rails Girls Summer of Code student and up for a (lightning) talk at a Ruby conference? You're in luck. We've created this little repo for you, with images you can use, a basic slides layout and some default slides mentioning stats and our awesome sponsors!

How to go about this? Well...'''git clone''' this repo and use it for your own purposes. 

Good luck! (or: break a leg!)
