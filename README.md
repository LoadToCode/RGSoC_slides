Rails Girls Summer of Code slides
============
Are you a Rails Girls Summer of Code student and up for a (lightning) talk at a Ruby conference? You're in luck. We've created this little repo for you, with images you can use, a basic slides layout and some default slides mentioning stats and our awesome sponsors!

How to go about this? Well... ```git clone``` this repo and use it for your own purposes. 
Or just download the files: example_slides.key or example_slides.pdf.

We included all sponsors here, but for a lightning talk, the first slide with the platinum & gold sponsors is really really enough.

Good luck! (or: break a leg!)


Huge thanks to @bioshrimp for the awesome artwork.
